## Authentication
Authentication is knowing the identity of the user. For example, Alice logs in with her username and password, and the server uses the password to authenticate Alice.

## Authorization
Authorization is deciding whether a user is allowed to perform an action. For example, Alice has permission to get a resource but not create a resource.
